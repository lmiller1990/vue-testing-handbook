## Vue Testing Handbook

Welcome to the Vue Testing Handbook!

## What is this?

This is a collection of short, focused examples on how to test Vue components. It uses [`vue-test-utils`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils), the official library for testing Vue components, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a modern testing framework. It covers the `vue-test-utils` API, as well as best practises and useful parts of the Jest API for testing Vue components. A working demo project with the examples is also included, which you can pull down and run yourself.

## Languages

The handbook is written in English. We have a Russian and Japanese translation in progress. Please make an issue if you would like to translate the book into your own language!

### Development

[Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) is used to generate the static website. Articles are written in markdown.

Clone the repo and run `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `yarn dev` to open the dev server. Access it on `localhost:8080`.

To edit a guide, update the code in the [src](https://github.com/lmiller1990/vue-testing-handbook/tree/master/src) directory. The markdown files are converted to HTML when deployed – no need to edit those.
