## Mocking Modules

Not directly related to Vue testing, more specific to Jest. Jest is used heavily throughout this handbook, though, and becoming widely adopted in the industry, so I think it deserves a section.

Some ideas:

1. reference the sections of the existing guide using Jest
2. Talk about the different kind of mocks and their use cases for Vue testing

- Manual mocks
- ES6 class mocks
- automatic mock
- calling `mockImplentation`?
